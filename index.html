                Rosy Felix was born in Sinaloa, Mexico in 1984. Nine years later she immigrated to Los Angeles, California where her father had been a laborer for many years. Though she was able to immigrate legally, thanks to her father’s work, the move to the United States was not without difficulties. Two of Rosy’s three sisters, stayed behind in Mexico while she was introduced to a whole new culture in a language she did not understand. For the better part of the decade that followed, Rosy’s life was spent coming and going from Sinaloa, where she lived with her sisters, and Los Angeles, where she lived with her parents and third sibling. Growing up in two countries provided Rosy with unique experiences that later found their way into her writing. After a battle with cancer in 2021, Rosy returned to college where she earned a B.A in English and Creative Writing. She now writes novels where unexpected and fearless women of color, charge bravely into adventure, romance and beyond.

                Rosy Félix nació en Sinaloa, México en el año 1984. Nueve años después emigró a Los Ángeles, California, donde su padre trabajaba como obrero. Aunque pudo inmigrar legalmente gracias al trabajo de su padre, el traslado a Los Estados Unidos no fue algo facil. Dos de las tres hermanas de Rosy se quedaron en México mientras ella conocía una cultura completamente nueva en un idioma que no entendía. Durante la mayor parte de la década siguiente, Rosy pasó su vida yendo y viniendo de Sinaloa, donde vivía con sus hermanas, y de Los Ángeles, donde vivía con sus padres y su tercera hermana. Haber crecido entre dos culturas le brindó experiencias únicas que luego se verian plasmadas en sus escritos. Después de una batalla con cancer en 2021, Rosy regresó a la Universidad donde obtuvo una licenciatura en Inglés y Escritura Creativa. Ahora escribe historias donde inesperadas e intrépidas mujeres racializadas se embarcan valientemente hacia la aventura, el romance y mucho más.

            <!--<span class="title">The Savage Ones</span>-->
            <p>Dear Reader,<br><br>I grew up around stories. Whether it was during the tamales assembly line during the holidays, my mother having coffee and pan dulce with her comadres, or my sisters chatting with friends as they babysat me. Most of these stories where things I overheard when people did not think I was listening. Others were intentional sharing of what the person considered vital information. No matter how the stories came to be told their purpose was always clear to me, in one way or another they were educational. Some lessons were simple: The proper way to cook a traditional dish, the upcoming holidays, tricks to clean the house, etc. However, the ones I found most interesting, were those having to do cultural expectations and each person's place within that culture. These stories had villains, heroes, right choices and wrong ones. Those who behaved in ways that matched the values of the culture were praised, admired and seemed to have lives that always ended well. Those that deviated from the collective norm even in the slightest, were shamed, outraised, usually women and whatever evil that befell them was justified as being a consequence for having deviated from their place in society. There were many words used to describe these women indesentes, mal educadas, faciles, and Salvajes being some of them. I believe the intention of sharing their stories with one another was to discourage any woman listing from following in their path. A path that always seemed to end in some terrible, severe or violent manner. It is of these women that I write about in <u>Las Salvajes (The Savage ones)</u>.</p>
            <p><u>Las Salvajes</u> is a string of short stories I am currently working on. They tell the lives of bold women who did not easily fit into society. I examine the impact these stories had on me as a child whose identity was being formed and assess what these stories mean to me now as grown woman who challenges many of the cultural norms placed upon her.</p>
