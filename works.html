              Dear Reader,<br /><br />I grew up around stories. Whether it was
              during the tamales assembly line during the holidays, my mother
              having coffee and pan dulce with her comadres, or my sisters
              chatting with friends as they babysat me. Most of these stories
              where things I overheard when people did not think I was
              listening. Others were intentional sharing of what the person
              considered vital information. No matter how the stories came to be
              told their purpose was always clear to me, in one way or another
              they were educational. Some lessons were simple: The proper way to
              cook a traditional dish, the upcoming holidays, tricks to clean
              the house, etc. However, the ones I found most interesting, were
              those having to do cultural expectations and each person's place
              within that culture. These stories had villains, heroes, right
              choices and wrong ones. Those who behaved in ways that matched the
              values of the culture were praised, admired and seemed to have
              lives that always ended well. Those that deviated from the
              collective norm even in the slightest, were shamed, outraised,
              usually women and whatever evil that befell them was justified as
              being a consequence for having deviated from their place in
              society. There were many words used to describe these women
              indesentes, mal educadas, faciles, and Salvajes being some of
              them. I believe the intention of sharing their stories with one
              another was to discourage any woman listing from following in
              their path. A path that always seemed to end in some terrible,
              severe or violent manner. It is of these women that I write about
              in <u>Las Salvajes (The Savage ones)</u>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <u>Las Salvajes</u> is a string of short stories I am currently
              working on. They tell the lives of bold women who did not easily
              fit into society. I examine the impact these stories had on me as
              a child whose identity was being formed and assess what these
              stories mean to me now as grown woman who challenges many of the
              cultural norms placed upon her.
